To my daughter I’ll leave behind
I can’t stop what’s metastasized
You’re the light in my decline
You’re the one thing I’ve done right
All my days have become numbered
And I have become numb to it
Spite flooded veins
Paranoid the pulse has lost me
My purpose has become nil
My cells multiply against my will
I’m sorry I won’t be there
For your first steps
When you’re falling
‘til you walk down the aisle
Standing tall
In a white drеss
I know life isn’t fair
When it’s time
And hеaven’s calling
We leave love behind
You were my reason to fight
My reason to fight
If this body is a temple
Then my walls were built on sand
There’s cracks in all my windows
The foundation is condemned
But it’s weathered many storms
I can’t take one more
I’m sorry I won’t be there
For your first steps
When you’re falling
‘til you walk down the aisle
Standing tall
In a white dress
I know life isn’t fair
When it’s time
And heaven’s calling
We leave love behind
You were my reason to fight
I never thought this would all end at 29
There’s a conflict in my soul;
A system failure of my life
No, I’ll never get enough
And you should never watch me die
But that’s just how this one goes
Think of me, think of me and close your eyes
Think of me and close your eyes
Think of me and close your eyes
Think of me and close your eyes
Think of me and close your eyes
Think of me and close your eyes
I’m sorry for the things I couldn’t help:
Think of me and close your eyes
For all the times you’ll walk through hell
For the cancer tearing my spirit out
When your world comes crashing down
Think of me and close your eyes
I’m sorry for this fleeting farewell
Despite all the fear I felt
Think of me and close your eyes
I loved you down to every last cell
Think of me and close your eyes
Don’t let your light run into the shadows
